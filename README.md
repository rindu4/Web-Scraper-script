# Web-Scraper-script
In this project, I created a Python script to scrape the latest news headlines from the BBC News website. Using the Requests library, I fetched the webpageâ€™s HTML, and with BeautifulSoup, I parsed the content to extract text from <h2> tags where the headlines were located.

The collected headlines were then saved in a text file (headlines.txt) in a clean, numbered format.

Outcome: The script successfully automated the process of collecting news headlines and storing them for offline use, demonstrating practical web scraping and data collection skills.
